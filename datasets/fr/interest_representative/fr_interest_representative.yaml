description: |
  Since July 1, 2017, interest representatives have been required to register on
  the AGORA digital directory. It aims to provide information to citizens on the
  relations between interest representatives and public officials when public decisions are taken.
  Thus, it is possible to consult a series of information to know the identity of the
  interest representatives registered in the directory (type of organization,
  contact details, identity of managers, customers, fields of activity, etc.) and the
  annual activity reports of each interest representative that detail their lobbying
  actions.
