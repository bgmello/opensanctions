  > schools, institutions and individuals under the Child Nutrition Act, 42 U.S.C. 1760(r)) and
  > pursuant to DHS Policy 1088 Excluded Providers. This means that a person or provider can be on
  > this DHS Excluded Provider list and yet is not an excluded Medicaid provider and is not a
  > disqualified Child Nutrition provider. DHS Policy 1088 regarding Excluded Providers allows a
  > person or facility to be included on the DHS Excluded Provider List for a variety of reasons
  > outlined in the policy. One reason can be when the person or provider failed, without good cause,
  > to perform or act in accordance with statues, rules, contracts or purchase orders.

  > Medical providers who are excluded from Arkansas Medicaid must not order, prescribe, or provide
