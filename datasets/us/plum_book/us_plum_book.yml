description: |
  The Plum Book is a listing of over 8,000 civil service leadership and support positions 
  (filled and vacant) in the Legislative and Executive branches of the Federal Government 
  that may be subject to noncompetitive appointments. These positions include agency heads 
  and their immediate subordinates, policy executives and advisors, and aides who report to 
  these officials. Many positions have duties which support Administration policies and programs.

  The people holding these positions usually have a close and confidential relationship with 
  the agency head or other key officials.

  Positions in the Plum Book include the following: 

  * **Executive Schedule (EX)** and salary-equivalent positions paid at the rates established 
    for Levels I through V of the Executive Schedule.
  * **Senior Executive Service (SES)** "General" positions (i.e., those positions which may be 
    filled by a career, noncareer, or limited appointment).
  * **Senior Foreign Service (SFS)** positions.
  * **Schedule C (SC)** positions excepted from the competitive service by the President, or by the 
    Director, Office of Personnel Management, because of the confidential or policy-determining 
    nature of the position duties.
  * **Other** confidential or policy-determining positions.
