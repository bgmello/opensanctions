  The Plum Book is a listing of over 8,000 civil service leadership and support positions 
  (filled and vacant) in the Legislative and Executive branches of the Federal Government 
  that may be subject to noncompetitive appointments. These positions include agency heads 
  and their immediate subordinates, policy executives and advisors, and aides who report to 
  these officials. Many positions have duties which support Administration policies and programs.

  The people holding these positions usually have a close and confidential relationship with 
  the agency head or other key officials.

  Positions in the Plum Book include the following:
    
    - **Schedule C (SC)** positions are excepted from the competitive service because of their 
      confidential or policy-determining character. The decision concerning whether to place a 
      position in Schedule C is made by the Director, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, upon 
      agency request.

    - **Senior Executive Service (SES)** is a personnel system covering top level policy, supervisory, 
      and managerial positions in most Federal agencies. The SES includes most Civil Service positions 
      above grade 15 of the General Schedule. 
      There are two types of SES positions:
      - **Career Reserved**
      - **General**
